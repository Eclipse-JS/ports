# Eclipse Ports
Ports of stuff, for the OS.
## Licensing information
All ports are licensed under the ports license.  
Example: https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048 is licensed under MIT, so the port would be licensed under MIT.  
  
The licensing information must be included in the ports folder.
## Folder Structure
The folder structure is of a typical root repo, however, instead of all the JS being in one big folder, each individual port has its own folder, with the name on it.  
  
It contains the license information (saved as LICENSE.txt), a precompiled build (for now), and the code being in src/.  
  
If the compiled build *is* the source code, no src/ folder is needed.
